# Ian's Portfolio
Hello! Welcome to my portfolio page. We started this page as one of our first assignments for the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp. Since then we have been constantly updating it and I have recently added four projects that I have worked on either individually or with students from the camp. 

## Portfolio Overview
<ins>About Me Page</ins><br>
Here I have a basic introduction about myself. Since we are currently creating this for class, that is the focal point of my bio. I then list some fun facts as well as personal links to projects.

Here I have my four projects that I am currently most proud of. The only one that I worked on outside of class is the Warzone Stat app. Check them out and let me know what you think!

This right now is a place holder. We were supposed to add this but it currently does nothing since we haven't learned about DB dev yet.
