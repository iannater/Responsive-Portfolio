# Ian's Responsive Portfolio

~~I got too carried away and had too much fun with making the page look cool and adding fun little things. I honestly forgot to complete this homework assignment due to my brain being rocked by java all week. I plan to complete this page before class on Monday~~

This is complete. Still having issues understanding the media queries but it all works. Please provide feedback on if the page is responsive the correct way. 

## Still Needs to be Completed

~~I have not figured out how to make the portfolio images and the main image on the home page responsive. I need to rewatch the class video and do some research online to setup the media queries. I believe I have finished all other tasks.~~

I figured this out but still dont fully understand the grid system after watching a few hours of youtube videos. I understand it when just using boxes and moving those around and stacking them but when I start adding my own content it gets confusing.
