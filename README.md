# Ian's Responsive Portfolio

I got too carried away and had too much fun with making the page look cool and adding fun little things. I honestly forgot to complete this homework assignment due to my brain being rocked by java all week. I plan to complete this page before class on Monday.

## Still Needs to be Completed

I have not figured out how to make the portfolio images and the main image on the home page responsive. I need to rewatch the class video and do some research online to setup the media queries. I believe I have finished all other tasks. 

Look forward to your feedback.
